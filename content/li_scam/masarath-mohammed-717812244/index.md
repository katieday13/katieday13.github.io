Opened as a typical bad job pitch.  And went over to wrong job description for the role.

That led to looking at Intellectt's postings and they don't comply with the pay transparency laws
of Washington State.

Your outreach was about a "Senior Devops Engineer" role.  Your job description is for a "Sr Software Systems Engineer."  Are  you sure you provided the right job description?

Beyond that... a quick sampling of Intellectt's job postings on LinkedIn indicates they are not a values match for me.

I will pass unless you can present something compelling.
