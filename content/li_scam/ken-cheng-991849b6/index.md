I owed a friend £22.91 for an Uber.

I transferred them £22.19 by accident.

They never brought it up.

Nobody would bring up 72p.

I did it on purpose. 

I've been doing it for years.

Every time I have to transfer someone money, I "accidentally" leave off a bit.

I call it the Plausible Deniability Typo.

£24.37 instead of £24.73.
£9.38 instead of £9.83.
£3.46 instead of £3.64.

Sometimes if I'm feeling really risky, I'll do £18.54 instead of £19.54.

They'd look like a complete tool to quibble over this.

Instead, they are a tool in a different way.

A tool for me to get to the top.

I've probably made £100 over 5 years.
